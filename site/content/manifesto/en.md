Dear supporters of open access to knowledge!

We wish to introduce to you the Free Genomics Manifesto – an ideal that speaks of
cooperation and freedom in the world of sciences regarding the functioning of the
human body and modern technologies. We want to propose a vision of a world in which
genetic knowledge is available to anyone, regardless of ethnicity or social
status. Therefore, we convey this appeal, a call for the freedom to benefit from the
sciences concerning our genes.

We believe that every person deserves equal access to genetic knowledge and the
ability to improve their own health and quality of life. We are convinced that there
is no such thing as "too stupid for knowledge." We all have the ability to learn and
improve, especially when they really need it. Often times, circumstances make the
human mind overcome limitations. Genetic knowledge, which concerns ourselves, should
not be reserved only for the chosen few. Every person has the right to know the
secrets of their own body and the mechanisms of its functioning.

We recognize that time is a valuable resource. When we suffer and must wait for a
specialist appointment, test results, or consultation with a medicine doctor, we
should have the opportunity to effectively help ourselves and check our own
condition. We should have access to open, verified research and services that allow
us to use it. As a result, instead of passively watching, we can act to improve our
own situation and that of our loved ones. No one should have the right to limit this.

Among us, there are those who, reading these words, do not feel the pressure of time
but, due to innate curiosity, want to know how to prevent potential diseases or
strengthen the body. Armed with information about the impact of genes on processes in
their bodies, they can shape their efficiency using commonly available substances
present in food products or extracted as so-called dietary supplements.

Curiosity is the force that drives science. The pursuit of discovering effective
methods for improving the functioning of the body, both at the cellular and general
level, should be possible for every person. Open and impartial access to the
achievements of science allows us to explore new paths leading to health and
well-being.

No one knows our bodies better than we do. We believe that, like human dignity,
people naturally have control over the condition of their bodies and access to the
most up-to-date scientific knowledge presented in the most accessible form
possible. Regardless of whether someone is sick and struggling with illness or
seeking to improve health and prevent future problems, everyone deserves the maximum
information about their condition and the possibilities for improving their life.

Naturally, taking care of oneself and knowing one's conditions does not conflict with
using professional help or advice. Cooperation with genetics, nutrition, and medicine
experts is key to managing risk and avoiding hazards. Voluntary partnerships between
individuals and specialists in these fields can create a space where science,
experience, and passion come together, leading to better results.

Therefore, users of human bodies, we appeal to you today: together let us strive to
achieve an information society in the field of genetics and health sciences as
well. Together we can create a world in which a person achieves greater control over
the state of their body, knowledge is open, and science serves us all, without being
limited by social, economic, or political barriers.

In the spirit of collective truth-seeking, we call for cooperation from scientists,
politicians, doctors, and anyone who sees the importance of this issue, to build a
global society based on free genomics and full access to genetic information.

Together, we can open the doors to incredible future possibilities, where everyone
has access to reliable knowledge and the freedom to decide about their own health and
life.

May the vision of free genomics presented here be fully realized and become a reality
for us and future generations. We invite everyone who feels they would like to bear
this vision to collaborate. Determination and commitment can change the world for the
better, leading to the achievement of a common goal: the freedom of genomics and
equal access to genetic knowledge for all.
