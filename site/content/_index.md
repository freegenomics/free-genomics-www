  heading: Our core values
  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.

      text: >
        Coffee is a small tree or shrub that grows in the forest
        understory in its wild form, and traditionally was grown
        commercially under other trees that provided shade. The
        forest-like structure of shade coffee farms provides habitat for
        a great number of migratory and resident species.
    - heading: "Single origin"
      image: /img/about-single-origin.jpg
      text: >
        Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known
        geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a
        specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of
        the coffee is then usually the place it was grown to whatever
        degree available.

      text: >
        Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on
        an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of
        relationships between organisms and their environment. What
        grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and
        careful consideration for nature and communities.

      text: >
        We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing
        coffee to you. That’s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into
        farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is
        grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about
        coffee farming on our blog.
