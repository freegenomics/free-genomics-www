blurb:
  heading: What is it?
  text: Free Genomics is an ideal and social movement connecting people who
    believe that genetic knowledge should be open and accessible to everyone on
    the planet.
corevalues:
  heading: Our core values
  text: Achieving Free Genomics is about putting its basic principles into
    practice. By working together we can ensure that the benefits of genomic
    research are equitably distributed and utilized for the betterment of
    society as a whole.
  list:
    - heading: Empowerment
      image: img/empowerment-img.jpg
      text: We believe that individuals should have control over their own bodies and
        actively participate in enhancing their situations without seeking
        external approval, thus fostering a sense of autonomy and self-efficacy.
    - heading: Curiosity

      text: >
        Curiosity propels progress and the quest for knowledge. Unrestricted
        access to scientific accomplishments empowers individuals to pursue
        novel avenues for health and well-being, thereby promoting innovation.
    - heading: Equal access
      image: img/equal-access-img.jpg
      text: All individuals, irrespective of ethnic background or social standing, are
        entitled to equal access to genetic knowledge and the opportunity to
        enhance their quality of life. Closing the disparity in accessing
        scientific information is crucial.
