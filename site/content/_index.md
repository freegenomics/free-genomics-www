blurb:
  heading: What is it?
  text: Free Genomics is an ideal and social movement connecting people who
    believe that genetic knowledge should be open and accessible to everyone on
    the planet.
corevalues:
  heading: Our core values
  text: Achieving Free Genomics is about putting its basic principles into
    practice. By working together we can ensure that the benefits of genomic
    research are equitably distributed and utilized for the betterment of
    society as a whole.
  list:
    - heading: Empowerment
      image: img/empowerment-img.jpg
      text: We firmly believe that everyone should possess the power to govern their
        own body and actively engage in improving their circumstances, rather
        than seeking external validation or or allowing precious time to be
        consumed by passivity. This cultivates a strong sense of autonomy and
        self-efficacy.
    - heading: Curiosity
      image: img/curiosity-img.jpg
      text: Curiosity drives progress and the pursuit of knowledge. By providing
        unrestricted access to scientific achievements, we empower individuals
        to explore new pathways for health and well-being. In nurturing this
        environment, we collectively pave the way for a future rich in discovery
        and innovation.
    - heading: Equal access
      image: img/equal-access-img.jpg
      text: All individuals, irrespective of ethnic background or social standing, are
        entitled to equal access to genetic knowledge and the opportunity to
        enhance their quality of life. Closing the disparity in accessing
        scientific information is crucial for ensuring fairness and promoting
        progress.
tools:
  heading: Tools
  text: The application of genetic knowledge enables us to improve the quality of
    life through a diverse array of tools. We employ well-established utilities
    that are supported by robust scientific evidence.
  list:
    - heading: DNA testing
      image: img/dna-testing.jpg
      text: Due to competition and variety in the consumer genetic testing industry,
        we now benefit from widespread access to affordable DNA testing and raw
        data results that can be employed in numerous ways.
    - heading: Cellular Processes Modulation
      image: img/cell-fixing.jpg
      text: By examining the connections between SNPs and cellular mechanisms, we can
        optimize our dietary habits to effectively support healing and
        regeneration processes within our bodies.
